        <h2>Smells Like Cookin'</h2>
        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
        <p><b><i>Smells Like Cookin'</i></b> is aimed at being the one stop place for all food lovers. 
            People who cook like to share their recipes to everyone so that everyone can enjoy it the same way. Similary people interested
            in knowing different recipes need some kind of forum to discuss first hand reviews of the recipes that people have posted. There
            are also some who cannot decide on the goodness of the recipe unless they taste it, and such people would be pleased if the owner 
            of the recipe can provide some kind of sample, that was lets say made in extra so that people can taste is and review it frankly.
            <br />My aim in this project is to bring such people on one common platform that is none other than <b><i>- Smells Like Cookin'</i></b>
        </p>
        
        <h4>Goals for the Project:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a site that is visually appealing and easy to use, considering general User Interactions and needs.</li>
            <li>Secure the site through login control so that only registered user can add/delete/modify recipes.</li>
            <li>Allow users to browse among all the recipes and provide good filter mechanism to narrow down results.</li>
            <li>Allow users to request the owner of the recipe for a sample of his recipe.</li>
            <li>Allow owner of recipes to modify or delete their recipes.</li>
            <li>Allow registered users to comment on recipes, and others to view them.</li>
            <li>Allow users to manage their samples requested either withdraw, complete or decline them.</li>
        </ul>
